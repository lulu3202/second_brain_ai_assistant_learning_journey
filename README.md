# 🚀 Second Brain AI Assistant – My Learning Journey  

## 🧠 What is This?  
This repository documents my hands-on learning from the **Second Brain AI Assistant Course**, an open-source GenAI course by **Paul Iusztin and the DecodingML team**.  

🔗 **Official Course Repo**: [Second Brain AI Assistant Course](https://github.com/decodingml/second-brain-ai-assistant-course)  

## 📌 Why This Course?  
It is quite rare to find an open-source course that walks you through the **end-to-end architecture and build** of an AI system—powered by **fine-tuned LLMs** (customized for your dataset) and **agentic RAG**.  

That’s exactly what this course delivers!

## 🔥 My Top 5 Takeaways  

### 1️⃣ **Start with the End in Mind 🎯**  
It's easy to get lost in details—always **anchor back to the architecture diagram** to keep the big picture in focus.  

### 2️⃣ **Every ML Project Starts with Data 📊**  
A well-structured **ETL pipeline** ensures smooth downstream processes like RAG feature pipelines & dataset generation.  

### 3️⃣ **The FTI & D-FTI-O Pipeline 🔄**  
Jim Dowling’s **Feature-Training-Inference (FTI) model** simplifies scalable AI systems—this is a **must-know for ML engineers**!  

### 4️⃣ **Offline vs. Online Pipelines ⚙️**  
The Second Brain AI Assistant decouples these:  
🔹 **Offline pipelines** (data ingestion, training)  
🔹 **Online pipelines** (real-time inference for the AI assistant)  

### 5️⃣ **Process > Tools 🛠️**  
Too many tools? No problem. **Focus on why you need them**, and picking up how they work becomes easier!

## 🛠️ Tools Explored  

✅ **Infrastructure**: `uv`, `Docker`, `Makefile`  
✅ **MLOps**: `ZenML` (pipelines), `Comet` (experiment tracking), `Opik` (prompt monitoring)  
✅ **Data Storage**: `MongoDB`  
✅ **LLM Fine-Tuning**: `Google Colab`, `Hugging Face`, `Unsloth`
